# Car-wash-webapp---Figma-UI-design

#Car wash ordering app - Human Computer Interaction#

Our web app topic is focused on an app, which offers a mobile car wash. This means that our
team would go to the spot where the car is and do the washing. This way our customers don't have to do
this for themselves. Our primary goal is to help people, to get some more time, by helping them out with
car caring obligations.

Team: Martin Bopkó, Štefan Dudaško, Simon Kokavec, Lenka Kubová, Tamás Szakál
